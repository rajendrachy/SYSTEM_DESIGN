# 1. Introduction to Coupling

## Definition
Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between different modules in a software system.

## Concept
- If Module A and Module B depend heavily on each other → **Tightly Coupled**
- If they are independent and interact only when required → **Loosely Coupled**

## Goal
In Software Engineering, the aim is always to have **Low (Loose) Coupling**.

## Why Low Coupling?
- Reduces system complexity  
- Makes code easier to read, write, and debug  
- Prevents a single error from crashing the entire system

# 2. Types of Coupling  
**(Hierarchy from Best to Worst)**

---

## 1. Data Coupling (Best / Lowest Dependency)

### Definition
Modules communicate by passing only the required data values.  
No sharing of internal logic or memory.

### Analogy
Person A owes Person B ₹50 → A simply gives ₹50.  
A does **not** give the whole wallet or bank details.

### Technical Example
Calling a function like:  
`sum(a, b)`  
You pass only the values.

---

## 2. Stamp Coupling

### Definition
Modules pass a composite data structure (object, record)  
even if only a part of it is required.

### Analogy
Instead of giving ₹50, Person A gives the **entire wallet** and says “take ₹50 from inside.”

### Technical Example
Passing a full `Student` object when only `Student_ID` is needed.  
If the object changes, the receiving module may break.

---

## 3. Control Coupling

### Definition
One module controls another by passing signals, flags, or switches  
to decide the flow of logic.

### Analogy
A train driver depends on a traffic signal.  
Signal (Module A) controls driver (Module B).

### Technical Example
Passing a boolean flag to a function to choose which logic path runs.

---

## 4. External Coupling

### Definition
Dependency arises due to external factors like hardware, protocols,  
or environmental limitations.

### Analogy
Two trains waiting for a single track.  
They are independent but coupled by the **shared external resource**.

### Technical Example
Two software modules accessing the same printer or legacy device.

---

## 5. Common Coupling

### Definition
Multiple modules share and access the same global data.

### Analogy
A public water tap → if one contaminates it, everyone is affected.

### Technical Example
Global variables shared across modules.  
If one changes it, other modules may crash due to unexpected change.

---

## 6. Content Coupling (Worst / Highest Dependency)

### Definition
One module depends on or modifies the **internal workings** of another.  
Violates the principle of information hiding.

### Analogy
A car and its engine — modifying internal engine parts directly is risky.

### Technical Example
One class directly modifying private variables of another class.

| Rank | Coupling Type      | Dependency Level | Desirability                |
|------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| 1    | Data Coupling       | Very Low         | Best (Most Desirable)       |
| 2    | Stamp Coupling      | Low              | Good                        |
| 3    | Control Coupling    | Medium           | Okay                        |
| 4    | External Coupling   | High             | Avoid if Possible           |
| 5    | Common Coupling     | Very High        | Bad                         |
| 6    | Content Coupling    | Extreme          | Worst (Avoid Completely)    |
