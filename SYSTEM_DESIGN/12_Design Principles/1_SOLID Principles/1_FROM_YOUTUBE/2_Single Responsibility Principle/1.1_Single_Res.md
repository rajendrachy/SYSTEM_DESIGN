# 1. Introduction

The video introduces the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, which is the **“S”** in the SOLID principles.  
SRP is one of the most important concepts for writing **scalable, maintainable, and robust code**.

## Goal
A class or module should have **one, and only one, reason to change**.

## Target Audience
Useful for:
- System design interviews  
- Becoming a better software engineer

# 2. Real-Life Analogy: The “Pani Puri” Vendor

To explain SRP, the speaker uses the example of a street food vendor selling **Pani Puri**.

## The Scenario
Imagine a single vendor (“Bhaiya”) running an entire stall alone.  
He performs **four distinct roles**:

1. **Chef** – Prepares Pani Puris  
2. **Logistics Manager** – Procures raw materials  
3. **Order System** – Takes orders from customers  
4. **Delivery Boy** – Delivers the food  

## The Problem (Bad Design / Monolith)
If this “Bhaiya” is represented as **one single class**, then:

### Single Point of Failure
If he falls ill → the entire business stops.

### Scalability Issues
If 100 customers arrive:
- One person cannot cook, take orders, procure items, and deliver food at the same time.  
- The system collapses under load.

### Bug Propagation
If the raw material (e.g., flour) is faulty →  
The entire product line suffers.

# 3. The Technical Solution: Applying SRP

To fix the monolithic structure, responsibilities are split into **independent modules**.

## Refactored Architecture

### 1. OrderPlacementModule
- Handles customer orders  
- Generates Order IDs  

### 2. FoodPreparationModule
- Handles cooking logic  
- Input: Order ID → Output: Cooking Status  

### 3. LogisticsModule
- Procures raw materials  
- Manages inventory  

### 4. DeliveryModule
- Delivers the final product to the customer  

### 5. ManagerClass
- Coordinates all other modules  
- Ensures smooth workflow  

This ensures **each class has only ONE responsibility**.

# 4. Benefits of Single Responsibility Principle

## Scalability
If orders increase →  
Add more chefs (FoodPreparationModule).  
No need to increase delivery or order staff.

## Resilience
If the DeliveryModule fails →  
The kitchen can still work.  
Failures become **isolated**, not system-wide.

## Maintainability
Updating code becomes easier:
- Changing order logic → modify only OrderPlacementModule  
- Cooking logic remains untouched

# 5. Summary Table

| Feature | Naive Approach (No SRP) | Experienced Approach (With SRP) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Structure** | Single Giant Class | Multiple Specialized Classes |
| **Responsibility** | Many (Cooking, Logistics, Orders, Delivery) | One per class |
| **Failure Impact** | Total System Failure | Isolated Failure |
| **Scalability** | Impossible / Very Hard | Highly Scalable |
| **Analogy** | One person doing 4 jobs | Team of 4 specialists |
