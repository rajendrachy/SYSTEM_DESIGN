Types of Operating Systems
8 types -> B, M, M, M, R, N, N , D







1.FCFS - First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling
The mechanics of FCFS are straightforward -> follow the arraival time if given 
-if arraival time is 0 for all then which come first run this whthout seeing the burst time






2.Shortest Job First or SJF CPU Scheduling - Shortest Job First (SJF) or Shortest Job Next (SJN) - (It is not preemitive)
- The Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling algorithm selects the process with the smallest burst time for execution. 
-This scheduling method may or may not be preemptive.
-Shortest Job First (Preemptive) or Shortest Remaining Time First








3.Shortest Remaining Time First (Preemptive SJF) Scheduling Algorithm
-The pre-emptive version of Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling is called Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
-Turn Around time = Completion time - arrival time
-Waiting Time = Turn around time - burst time





4.Round Robin Scheduling(RR)
-mode-> Premitive 
-Simler to FCFS extra thing is time quantun
-Used in time sharing systems
-Critearea -> Arrival time + Time quantum

5.Priority Scheduling
-Priority Scheduling can be implemented in two ways:
a.Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling ->  the currently running process will complete first.
b.Preemptive Priority Scheduling
