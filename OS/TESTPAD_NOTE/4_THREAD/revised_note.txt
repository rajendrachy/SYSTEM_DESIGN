1. Types of Thread : -> 

- User Level & Kernel Level Thread -> https://youtu.be/-NONm-Jq34Y?si=zaIyvVHjlmY1mKc0 => yt_link

- Hybrid Thread ->  combination od ULT & KLT






2. Thread Models : -> 
- Many to one : -> Many => user and  ONE => Kernel 
- One to one
- Many to Many







2. Thread OPeration: ->
Creation – pthread_create() in POSIX, CreateThread() in Windows. 
• Termination – pthread_exit() or return from function. 
• Synchronization – mutexes, semaphores, condition variables. 
• Scheduling 





3. Thread Safety Issues 
• Race Condition – Two threads access shared data simultaneously, causing 
inconsistent results. 
• Deadlock – Two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources. 
• Starvation – Thread never gets CPU due to scheduling. 
Solution: Use mutexes, semaphores, or monitors to synchronize threads safely.
