1. Process Definition :
- A process is a program in execution.





2. Difference between Program and Process
- A process is an ‘active’ entity instead of a program, 
which is considered a ‘passive’ entity.
- Process is created then Memory is allocated and PCB is created to 
keep various data and pointers related to addresses




3. Process Management Tasks
- C, R, B, S, R, D, T, W, C 







4. Process Management
- Memory Layout :-

Text Segment:
    Contains binary code (the program instructions)

Data Segment:
    Contains global data and static variables

Stack:
    Contains temporary data such as:
        - Function parameters
        - Return addresses
        - Local variables

Heap:
    Contains dynamically allocated memory for the process during run time








5. PCB (Process Control Block) :-

-process state diagrem-> YT-channel -> https://youtu.be/2dJdHMpCLIg?si=HDSB-9YIl0mptzKr
- Multi programming & multi tasking -> https://youtu.be/3MqyDWDpZoI?si=Cb7oeh80dh_9sXSJ
- Multi programming -> non preemptive
- Multi tasking -> time sharing, preemptive














12. Types of Process:
- CPU bound processes: If the process is intensive in terms of CPU operations, then it is called
CPU bound process.
- I/o bound processes : If the process is intensive in terms of I/O operations then it is called
I/O bound process.







13. Types of Schedulers
-Long-term – performance:
Short-term – Context switching time:
Medium-term – Swapping time:

18. Criteria for selecting CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- CPU utilization : CPU utilization can range from 0 to 100 but in a real-time system, it varies from 40 to  90 percent 
depending on the load upon the system
- Throughput : number of processes being executed and completed per unit of time  is called throughput.
- Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
- Response Time = CPU Allocation Time(when the CPU was allocated for the first) - Arrival Time











32. IPC :

36. PROBLEMS DUE TO PROCESS COMMUNICATION
a. Race condition : -> https://youtu.be/9F7I6H-A1SY?si=RT_0jCXT5k460UEI => yt_link
 - Concept of synchronous and asynchronous
 - synchronous -> execute full process p1 then start another process p2
 - Asynchronous -> execute simaltineous process p1, p2





b. Deadlocks: -> https://youtu.be/rWFH6PLOIEI?si=If6XPW8Q_cekMiao
 - Necessary condition:
   ~ Mututal exclusion
   ~ No preemption
   ~ Hold and Wait
   ~ Circulat Wait
=> p1 --> R1 => Request
=> R1 --> P1 => Allocation





c. Starvation: -> https://youtu.be/FF88j59yLMk?si=r6epyd5OI3_1ZTk2 -> yt_link
 - Causes
    . low priority -> process with low proprity wait forever & process with high priority uses a process constantly 
    . Deadlock 

  starvation vs Deadlock
  - starvation is lived stock & deadlock is circular wait

  . fails safe method -> starvation is also called a fail safe methos & which prevent the Deadlocks temporary


  - method to handle starvation
   . Allocated of Resource should be taken by cpu
   . Random choose of process method
   . Scheduling algorithm

40. Solution of critical section problem 
a. Semaphore : -> https://youtu.be/yiFBRQLgeZA?si=Zyq5va54J1hFdmvO -> yt_link
   ~ 3 creterias
   . Mututal exclusion
   . Progress
   . Bounded wait
