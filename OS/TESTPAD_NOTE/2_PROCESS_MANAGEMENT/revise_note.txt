1. Process Definition : -> https://youtu.be/B0Uq9Mjz4gM?si=2X9hK_s48qQoXWD5 => yt_link

- A process is a program in execution.





2. Difference between Program and Process: -> https://youtu.be/0LwyBjMuIhg?si=m8VhZ9F1VSxCo6vL => yt_link

- A process is an ‘active’ entity instead of a program, 
which is considered a ‘passive’ entity.
- Process is created then Memory is allocated and PCB is created to 
keep various data and pointers related to addresses




3. Process Management Tasks
- C, R, B, S, R, D, T, W, C 










4. Process Management
- Memory Layout :-> https://youtu.be/grriYn6v76g?si=-45K6ahut9Dv8oL_ => yt_link


Text Segment:
    Contains binary code (the program instructions)

Data Segment:
    Contains global data and static variables

Stack:
    Contains temporary data such as:
        - Function parameters
        - Return addresses
        - Local variables

Heap:
    Contains dynamically allocated memory for the process during run time

10. Process state diagram explain ->
- New, Ready, Running, Wait & Terminated
-process state diagrem-> YT-channel -> https://youtu.be/2dJdHMpCLIg?si=HDSB-9YIl0mptzKr

- Multi programming & multi tasking -> https://youtu.be/3MqyDWDpZoI?si=Cb7oeh80dh_9sXSJ
- Multi programming -> non preemptive
- Multi tasking -> time sharing, preemptive















12. Types of Process:
- CPU bound processes:-> https://youtu.be/b8lRqwTuWZE?si=pWK7n149b2bU7Ij2 => yt_link

 If the process is intensive in terms of CPU operations, then it is called
CPU bound process: -> 


- I/o bound processes : https://youtu.be/b8lRqwTuWZE?si=pWK7n149b2bU7Ij2 => yt_link

- If the process is intensive in terms of I/O operations then it is called
I/O bound process.







13. Types of Schedulers
-Long-term – performance:-> https://youtu.be/AKCXDlGZ3-8?si=H5obNWZyFHw6XT1h => yt_link
 - it is also called a JOb Schedulers
 - new ----> Ready


-Short-term – Context switching time: -> https://youtu.be/bEucoZ3WUx4?si=bUD-UG6xY6W8vBUf => yt_link
- Faster than both
- Ready ----------> Running

16. CPU SCHEDULING :
17. CPU Scheduling Algorithms: link -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/ => gfg_link



 First Come First Serve (FCFS) -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/first-come-first-serve-cpu-scheduling-non-preemptive/ => gfg_link
- FCFS suffers from Convoy effect

# Convay Effective : -> https://youtu.be/XolG_3Yu_QA?si=E2kQ8fUXmkzfL3oQ => yt_link


# Convay Effective  : -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/convoy-effect-operating-systems/ => gfg_link







 Shortest Job First (SJF) [Non Preemptive] -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/shortest-job-first-or-sjf-cpu-scheduling/ => gfg_link

- One of the demerit SJF has is starvation.
- The Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling algorithm selects the process with the smallest burst time for execution.






 Shortest Remaining Time First [Preemptive] -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/shortest-remaining-time-first-preemptive-sjf-scheduling-algorithm/ => gfg_link

- Shortest remaining time first is the preemptive version of the Shortest job first
- Like the shortest job first, it also has the potential for process starvation.






 Priority Scheduling [Preemptive & Non Preemptive] -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/priority-scheduling-in-operating-system/ => gfg_link
- One of the most common demerits of the Preemptive priority CPU scheduling algorithm is the Starvation Problem







 Round robin (RR) -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/round-robin-scheduling-in-operating-system/
- Spends more time on context switching.

# RR -> https://youtu.be/TxjIlNYRZ5M?si=6_KmgGpNOQG_evyP => yt_link












18. Criteria for selecting CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- CPU utilization : CPU utilization can range from 0 to 100 but in a real-time system, it varies from 40 to  90 percent 
depending on the load upon the system
- Throughput : number of processes being executed and completed per unit of time  is called throughput.
- Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
- Response Time = CPU Allocation Time(when the CPU was allocated for the first) - Arrival Time











32. IPC : -> https://youtu.be/bqfOtLF-jyo?si=6JFVEOsRxaCccM9K => yt_link

Link GFG -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/inter-process-communication-ipc/

# Two type of process : -> https://youtu.be/bqfOtLF-jyo?si=6JFVEOsRxaCccM9K => yt_link

 - Independent process -> Nothing common, data not shared 

 - co-operative process -> Affect another process, data shared, common like variable or memory
















36. PROBLEMS DUE TO PROCESS COMMUNICATION
a. Race condition : -> https://youtu.be/9F7I6H-A1SY?si=RT_0jCXT5k460UEI => yt_link
 - Concept of synchronous and asynchronous
 - synchronous -> execute full process p1 then start another process p2 -> no problem
 - Asynchronous -> execute simaltineous process p1, p2 -> problem -> this is race condition












b. Deadlocks: -> https://youtu.be/rWFH6PLOIEI?si=If6XPW8Q_cekMiao => yt_link

 - Necessary condition:
   ~ Mututal exclusion
   ~ No preemption
   ~ Hold and Wait
   ~ Circulat Wait
=> p1 --> R1 => Request
=> R1 --> P1 => Allocation









c. Starvation: -> https://youtu.be/FF88j59yLMk?si=r6epyd5OI3_1ZTk2 -> yt_link
  -> prodess do not have resource this is starvation : -> p1 -> R1


 - Causes
    . low priority -> process with low proprity wait forever & process with high priority uses a process constantly 
    . Deadlock 

  starvation vs Deadlock
  - starvation is lived stock & deadlock is circular wait

  . fails safe method -> starvation is also called a fail safe methos & which prevent the Deadlocks temporary


  - method to handle starvation
   . Allocated of Resource should be taken by cpu
   . Random choose of process method
   . Scheduling algorithm











   37. Process Synchronization : -> https://youtu.be/Z1IpjGa8AZc?si=Bu_u2XcdCikyp6yr -> yt_link








39. Critical section : -> https://youtu.be/a9LEHups10M?si=s0vC4HVhW7qwoa8o -> yt_link










40. Solution of critical section problem  : 

a. Semaphore : -> https://youtu.be/yiFBRQLgeZA?si=Zyq5va54J1hFdmvO -> yt_link
-Semaphore in OS is a synchronization

   ~ 3 creterias
   . Mututal exclusion
   . Progress
   . Bounded wait 


-> Wait, p, down -> all are same
-> up, v, signel -> all are same









 # Semaphore types:

 a. Binary Semaphore : -> https://youtu.be/l5-3mbBV1BQ?si=_xXJOK_zaifVNkLl => yt_link
 - In these types of Semaphores the integer value of the semaphore can only be
either 0 or 1








 b. Counting Semaphore : -> 
 - If the value of the Semaphore is anywhere above 0, processes can access the critical section or the
shared resources.
- if the value is 0, it means that there aren't any resources that are available or the critical section 
 is already being accessed by a number of processes
-  Counting semaphores are generally used when the number of instances of a resource is
more than 1, and multiple processes can access the resource.
