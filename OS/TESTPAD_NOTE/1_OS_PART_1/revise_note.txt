1. What is operating system ?

2. operating system goals.

3. Structure of the OS. => U, A, O, H

4. Computer Architecture => ISA → Instruction Set Architecture
 HSA → Hardware System Architecture
 AGP → Accelerated Graphics Port
 PCI → Peripheral Component Interconnect

5.CPU – Central Processing Unit 

6.RAM – Random Access Memory

7. Operating System Mode
 - User Mode
 - Kernel Mode
 - System calls are used to change mode
from User to Kernel

8. Kernel 
- When operation system boots, kernel is first part of OS to load in main memory
- The kernel code is usually loaded in to protected area of memory
- Kernel does not interact directly with user, but it interacts using SHELL and other
programs and hardware.




9. Kernel includes:
- S, S, I, M
- kernel provides services for process management, file management, I/O  
management, memory management.
- System calls are used to  provide these type of services.



10. System calls
- System calls are also called software-interrupts.

11. Starting an Operating System(Booting)
yt_channel -> https://youtu.be/ecu4Lay1Xa0
- BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) chip
- Power-On Self Test (POST)
- MBR → Master Boot Record 







12. BIOS(Basic input output system)
- BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM/EPROM (Erasable Programmable
Read-Only Memory) chip known as firmware on the PC motherboard





13. UEFI
- UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It does the same job as a BIOS, 
but with one basic difference: it stores all data about initialization and startup in an .efi 
file, instead of storing it on the firmware.
- This .efi file is stored on a special partition called EFI System Partition (ESP) on the 
hard disk. This ESP partition also contains the bootloader
- UEFI was designed to overcome many limitations of the old BIOS, including:







14. Functions of Operating System:
- Process Management
- Memory management: Main memory is a volatile storage device
- File Management
 =>  FAT12 (floppy  disks) 
 FAT16 (DOS and older versions of Windows) 
 FAT32 (older versions  of Windows) 
 NTFS (newer versions  of Windows) 
 EXT3 (Unix/Linux) 
 HFS+ (Max OS X)
- Device Management or I/O Management
- Security & Protection
- User Interface Mechanism
 => There are two types of user interfaces 
1. Command Line Interface
2. Graphical user Interface






15. History of Operating System
- The First Generation (1940's to early 1950's)
      -No Operating System
- The Second Generation (1955-1965) : First operating system was introduced in the early 1950's.It was called GMOS(General Motors Operating System)
- The Third Generation (1965-1980)
 Introduction of multiprogramming
 Development of Minicomputer
- The Fourth Generation (1980-Present Day)
 Development of PCs
 Birth of Windows/MaC OS











#Types of Operating Systems
1. Batch Operating System
2. Multiprogramming Operating System
3. Time-Sharing OS
4. Multiprocessing OS : Multiprocessor operating systems are also known as parallel OS or tightly
coupled OS
5. Distributed OS
6. Network OS
7. Real Time OS
8. Embedded OS
