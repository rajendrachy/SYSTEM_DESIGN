# OSI Model: Layers & Protocol Data Units (PDU)

**Topic:** Computer Networks (OSI Architecture)
**Concept:** Encapsulation and Data Units

## 1. What is a PDU?
As data moves through the layers of the OSI model, it changes its form and typically acquires a new header (and sometimes a footer). This specific form of data at each layer is called a **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)**.

## 2. Layer-wise Data Units (PDU)

The data units change from the top layer (Application) down to the bottom layer (Physical) as follows:

| Layer No. | Layer Name | Data Unit (PDU) | Key Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 7** | **Application** | **Data** | The actual message or file generated by the user (e.g., an email, HTTP request). |
| **Layer 6** | **Presentation** | **Data** | Handles formatting, encryption, and compression; the unit is still referred to as Data. |
| **Layer 5** | **Session** | **Data** | Manages session controls; the unit remains Data. |
| **Layer 4** | **Transport** | **Segment** | The large data message is broken down into smaller pieces called **Segments** (in TCP) or **Datagrams** (in UDP). |
| **Layer 3** | **Network** | **Packet** | Logical addressing (IP Addresses) is added to the segment to create a **Packet**. Used by Routers. |
| **Layer 2** | **Data Link** | **Frame** | Physical addressing (MAC Addresses) and error detection are added to the packet to create a **Frame**. Used by Switches. |
| **Layer 1** | **Physical** | **Bit** | The frame is converted into a stream of **Bits** (0s and 1s) to be transmitted over wires or wireless media. |

## 3. The Process: Encapsulation

When a sender transmits a message, the data undergoes **Encapsulation**:
1.  **Upper Layers:** The User generates **Data**.
2.  **Transport:** Data is chopped into **Segments**.
3.  **Network:** Segments become **Packets** (IP added).
4.  **Data Link:** Packets become **Frames** (MAC added).
5.  **Physical:** Frames become **Bits** sent over the wire.

*At the Receiver's end, the process is reversed (Decapsulation).*
