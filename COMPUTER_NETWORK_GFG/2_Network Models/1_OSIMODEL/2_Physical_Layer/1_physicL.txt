# Physical Layer in OSI Model
- The physical Layer is the bottom-most layer in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model, responsible for the physical and electrical transmission of data

- The physical layer sends data bits from one device(s) (like a computer) to another device(s).







# Protocols in Physical Layer
 - Typically, a combination of hardware and software programming makes up the physical layer
 - eg.
 - Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) : Widely used for wired networks.
   Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) : For wireless communication.
   Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) : Short-range wireless communication.
   USB (Universal Serial Bus) : For connecting devices over short distances.
