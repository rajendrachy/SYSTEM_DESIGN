## 1. Definition
* A **Firewall** is a security system that establishes a barrier between a **Secure Internal Network** (Trusted) and an **Unsecure External Network** (Untrusted, e.g., The Internet).
* **Analogy:** It acts like a **Security Guard** who checks every person (Data Packet) entering or leaving a building (Network).

## 2. Working Mechanism
* **Monitoring:** It constantly watches the traffic flow (Incoming and Outgoing).
* **Filtering:** It decides whether to **Allow** or **Block** specific traffic based on a defined set of **Security Rules**.
    * *Example:* Block all traffic from a suspicious IP address.
    * *Example:* Allow web traffic (Port 80) but block unknown ports.

## 3. Types of Firewalls (Brief)
1.  **Hardware Firewall:** Physical devices placed between the gateway and the local network. (e.g., functionalities inside a Router).
2.  **Software Firewall:** Applications installed on the host operating system (e.g., Windows Firewall).

## 4. Key Benefits
* Prevents **Hacking** and **Unauthorized Access**.
* Protects against **Malware** and **Viruses** from the internet.
* Provides privacy by controlling outbound data.
